                Watch the sunrise along the coast
        As we're both getting old
        I can't describe what I'm feeling
        And all I know is we're going home
        So please don't let me go, oh
        Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh
        <br><br>
        And if it's right
        I don't care how long it takes
        As long as I'm with you
        I've got a smile on my face
        Save your tears, it'll be okay
        All I know is you're here with me
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        <br><br>
        Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh
        I can't describe, whoa-oh
        I wish I could live through every memory again
        Just one more time before we float off in the wind
        <br><br>
        And all the time we spent
        Waiting for the light to take us in
        Have been the greatest moments of my life
        <br><br>
        I don't care how long it takes
        As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
        Save your tears, it'll be okay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
        <br><br>
        Yeah, if with me
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        I can't describe, oh, oh
            </p>
